*Hoppscotch is a light-weight, web based API development suite. Hoppscotch was built from the ground up with ease of use and accessibility in mind. Hoppscotch provides all the functionality needed for developers with a minimalist and unobtrusive UI. Hoppscotch is free-to-use and as an added perk completely Open Source.*
