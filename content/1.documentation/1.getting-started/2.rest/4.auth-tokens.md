# Using auth tokens

In this section, we'll look at passing Authorization and Authentication Information in our requests, by accessing the GitHub API.

Try making a GET request to the url `https://api.github.com/user`.

You'll get the following response:

```json
{
  "message": "Requires authentication",
  "documentation_url": "https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/users#get-the-authenticated-user"
}
```

This is beacause you are not authorized to access the API and inorder to gain access you would need to authenticate yourself. We use tokens to authenticate a user and to do so we first need to generate an access token from GitHub.

## Generating access token

To get access to the GitHub API, you first need to generate a personal access token. For our demonstration we will generate one granting access to public repositories.

1. Login to GitHub account
2. Goto your [personal access tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and click on generate new token
3. Select tokens (classic)
4. You should see a page like the one below:
![GitHub Access Token](/images/getting-started/rest/github-access-token.png)
5. Specify the note as Hoppscotch API so that you can remember why you created it
6. Under the `select scope` section only check `public_repo`
7. Scoll down and click on `Generate token`
8. You just generated your access token, now copy the token to your clipboard

## Storing auth token in a variable

::alert{type="info"}
::list{type="info"}

- It is a recommended safe-practice to have your auth details in environment variables rather than inputting it directly to the authorization tab.

::
::

1. Create an evironment titled `Global`
2. Create a variable called `token` and paste the token from github as it's value
![Auth token variable](/images/getting-started/rest/create-token-variable.png)
3. Now open the Authorization tab and select `Bearer Token` from the dropdown list
4. Input the token as shown below, make sure that you reference the token in variable format, ie `<<token>>`

5. Click on Send

You Should Be able to see the number of public repos you have made in GitHub in a similar response as shown below:

```json
{
  "login": "iloveHoppscotch",
  ...
  "company": "@hoppscotch",
  "blog": "https://hoppscotch.io,
  "bio": "Your favorite way to build APIs.",
  "twitter_username": "hoppscotch_io",
  ...
  "public_repos": 50,
  "public_gists": 10,
  "followers": 100,
  "following": 5,
  ...
}
```
