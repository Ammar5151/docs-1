# Organizing your requests

## Creating a collection

It is always a best practice to organize your requests when you test multiple API endpoints. You can organize your requests categorically for future reference or for collaboration with your team using collections.

You can create a new collection on Hoppscotch by clicking the collections icon on the sidebar and clicking the `new` button.

Let's try making a collection for our [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com) called `Rick&Morty`.

## Adding requests to a collection

Now, let's save our current query as `GET All Alive Mort-ies` and save it in our `Rick&Morty` Collection.

- Click on the `Save` button
- Give your request a name
- Add it to your collection

You can add multiple requests to a collection and even create subfolders inside a collection to further organize your requests.
