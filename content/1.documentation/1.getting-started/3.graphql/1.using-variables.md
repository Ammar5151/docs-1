# Using variables in a GraphQL query

Hoppscotch allows you to pass variables in the query to fetch data dynamically.

To demonstrate the use of variables lets write a query to get the episode details of episode name `Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind` (id=10).

## Variables

Goto the variables section and define the variable.

```graphql
{
  "id": "10"
}
```

## Using the variable in the query

Now create a query `getEpisode` with variables as shown below:

```graphql
query getEpisode($id: ID!) {
  episode(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    air_date
    episode
  }
}
```

Hoppscotch will retrieve the value of the variable and exeute the query to get the below response.

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "episode": {
      "id": "10",
      "name": "Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind",
      "air_date": "April 7, 2014",
      "episode": "S01E10"
    }
  }
}
```
