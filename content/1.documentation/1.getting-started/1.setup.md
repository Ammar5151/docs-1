# Setup Hoppscotch

Setting up Hoppscotch is easy. Open the [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io) app and start using it.

## Locally served APIs

If you're using Hoppscotch to test your locally served APIs, it is reccomended that you install the **Hoppscotch Browser Extension**. Once installed, switch the interceptor on Hoppscotch to **Browser Extension** from the settings page or bottom bar to add support for `localhost` protocols.

### Pre-requisites

1. Install the browser extension from the below links:

   - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hoppscotch)
   - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hoppscotch-browser-extens/amknoiejhlmhancpahfcfcfhllgkpbld?hl=en)

2. Click on the Hoppscotch browser extension icon from browser toolbar and add a new origin as `http://localhost` or `http://localhost:8000` as per your local server configuration.

3. Refresh the Hoppscotch web app
4. Open the interceptor and change the middleware to the browser extension

> You can either go to the settings and enable the use of the browser extension as shown below:

> Or you can open the interceptor menu and change the middleware as shown below:

## Deployed APIs

To test your deployed APIs, you can use the [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io) app.

### Fix CORS errors

If your API is [`CORS`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) enabled, you should switch the interceptor to **Proxy** from Settings page or the bottom bar to avoid `CORS` errors.

Proxy mode helps you to:

- Bypass `CORS` (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions
- Hide your IP address
- Access APIs served in non-HTTPS (`http://`) endpoints
- Use your own Proxy middleware URL
