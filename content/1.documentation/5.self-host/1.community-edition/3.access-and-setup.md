# Access and Setup

After successfully running the necessary containers, the next step involves creating an administrator account to manage Hoppscotch. The system automatically designates the first user who logs in through the admin dashboard as the administrator.

## Creating an Administrator Account

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3100`.
2. This will grant you access to the admin dashboard.
3. Log in using your credentials or create a new account.
4. The first user to log in will be given administrator privileges.
