# Audit Logs

In Enterprise Hoppscotch, a record of all actions taken on the platform is saved which can be used to know what events happened, who performed them, and when they occurred. With the information present users may be able to draw insights related to the platform.

### Log Format

Every event that occurred on the platform is saved in the following format.

```bash
{
  "event": "",
  "timestamp": "",

    "name": ""
